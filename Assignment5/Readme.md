# Assignment 5

In this i tried experimenting many things in a ways to achieve good accuracy, was unable to debug the data augmentation error in my code hence the expected accuracy is quite low as per me, tried with diiferent models such as VGG16,resnet50,VGG19,Xception,MobileNetV2,InceptionV3,resnet_v2,inception_v3,inception_resnet_v2 as a backbone network, increased layers, decreased droupout, played with batch size as well, tried with changing optimizer to adam and checked with decaying the learning rate with SGD.

Studied few of the solutions for varoius other techniques to improve accuracy for image classification
