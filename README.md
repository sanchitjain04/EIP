Definations for the following:

 1. Convolution: &nbsp;&nbsp;Convolution in context with Convolutional Neural Network refers to some numerical values by perfoming some comuptation on pixel values we get output in form of numerical value.

2. Filters/Kernels:&nbsp;&nbsp; A filter (or kernel) is actually a part of of the Convulutional Neural Network layered architecture, which means an operator applied completely to the image such that it changes the information encoded in the pixels.

3. Epochs:&nbsp;&nbsp;WE can say an Epoch when complete dataset is passed completely through the neural network one time.

4. 1x1 Convolution:&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to channel wise pooling in deep neural network with 1x1 dimention

5. 3x3 Convolution:&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to above except with 3x3 dimention

6. Feature Maps:&nbsp;&nbsp; In CNN Feature Map is used to find or capture the output by applying some filters to sample input image for each layer.

7. Activation Function: &nbsp;&nbsp; Activation functions are equations that decide the output of a neural network. The function is attached to each neuron in the network.

8. Receptive Field:&nbsp;&nbsp;  The receptive field in CNN refers to the area of the input space that affects a specific unit of the network.
